### Our Values

* **Equality** - We believe all are born equal. Specifically, that everyone has the right to access quality, medical healthcare regardless of their ability to pay, their gender, ethnicity, age, religious or political persuasion, sexual orientation or any other differentiating factor.
* **Community** - We acknowledge that humans do not and cannot successfully operate in isolation from one another. Neither as near neighbours, nor as neighbours separated by continents. We believe in ‘community’ in the broadest sense of the word and will work to support the users and employees of the Clinic to overcome difficulties, inequalities and threats to their wellbeing and the wellbeing of this project. We seek, as a charity, to emulate the sense of mutual trust and belonging that has developed and deepened between Trevor and Adisu, with the rural community of Lalibela.
* **Ambitious** - We are ambitious in our plans for the Lalibela New Life Medical Centre, supporting it to deliver lasting change to the community of people it serves for generations to come. We believe there is a solution for every problem.
* **Greater than the sum of our parts** - We recognise we are stronger together than alone. We believe in what we are doing and know that respecting our combined knowledge and pooling our combined talents is the most effective way of achieving the charity’s aims. We are committed to developing our talent pool in any way we can.
* **Caring** - We believe in the healing and restorative power of human caring for one another and will promote this whenever we can.
