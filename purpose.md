## The Purpose of the Trust

<div class="box">
To bring the relief of sickness and the preservation and protection of good health among people residing in Lalibela (Ethiopia) and surrounding villages.
</div>

The World Health Organisation has identified that poverty and environmental factors are major contributors to death, disease and disability in many parts of the world. Indeed, the seed that was sown in the creation of this charity, was a young man whose life lay in the balance for no other reason than a simple snake bite and a lack of financial resources to have it treated. The Lalibela New Life Medical Centre has been established to put an end to such avoidable suffering, and you now have a part to play in that, for which we are very grateful.

### How will the Trust achieve this?

By the provision of grants to the Lalibela New Life Medical Centre that will:

- provide medical and nursing care for the treatment of illness and disability;
- provide maternal care and family planning advice; and
- provide an education service to promote awareness of the prevention of disease.

The Medical Centre provides for both in-patient and out-patient treatment and is open to anyone in need of medical support. Medical and nursing treatments are provided by qualified nursing and medical professionals. The centre is a first port of call for people in Lalibela and surrounding villages, requiring medical, nursing and maternity care. These are typically poor farming families. The nearest main hospital is 40 miles away, and has poor standards of hygiene and high rates of cross-infection. Medical care is provided in line with the patient's ability to pay. In this way, the very poor are able to access free medical and nursing care, maternity services, and education about self-care protocols.

- Growing future medical skills in the region to continue this work.
